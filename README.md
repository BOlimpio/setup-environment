# Setup your Ubuntu environment

The [ubuntu-environment-setup.sh](https://github.com/BOlimpio/setup-environment/blob/main/ubuntu-environment-setup.sh) script was created to install the **basic tools** that you will use with focus on DevOps and AWS as a cloud provider on the ubuntu operating system.

## The following tools are currently installed:

* vs code
* notepad++ (via snap)
* docker
* kubectl
* eksctl
* awscli2
* python
* pip
* git
* terraform

**Feel free to include other tools or improve the code**, which by the way, is pretty basic because it was just for my personal need.

I hope it helps you to have less work when getting a new environment!

## How to use:

Run this command in the folder where the script is:

```sh
sudo ./ubuntu-environment-setup.sh
```
